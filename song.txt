Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this it will help you some sunny day"

"Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above"
